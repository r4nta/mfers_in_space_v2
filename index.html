    <p><u>Will you be present after mint?</u></p>
    <p>Yes, we will be here. There is (of course) no roadmap, but one thing is for sure: we are going to support the collection going forward.</p><br>
    <p><u>Is the contract safe to mint?</u></p>
    <p>We are using the most up-to-date hashlips open source contracts (ERC721), it is safe. What's also great is, that this contract is super gas optimized. You won't be able to mint cheaper than with this contract.</p><br>
